As a part of the machine learning research team at Vyākruthi Technologies, I contributed to a data-driven project aimed at analyzing and predicting student academic performance using Educational Data Mining (EDM) and predictive analytics. The focus was on building interpretable and accurate models to assist educators in identifying at-risk students, improving academic interventions, and enhancing learning outcomes, especially for students in Bangladesh’s Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) humanities programs.
